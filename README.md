# RISC-ROT
Secure Boot for RV32IMAC-Based RISC-V SoC: A Lightweight FPGA-Prototyped Root of Trust Implementation
Implement a lightweight, hardware-enforced secure boot mechanism for a minimal 5-stage RV32IMAC RISC-V core, incorporating cryptographic verification and Root of Trust (RoT) in ROM. Demonstrate and benchmark the secure boot system on FPGA using resource-constrained open hardware.
